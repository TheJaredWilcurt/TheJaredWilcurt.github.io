Since the new version is now at a more appropriate URL, there were 2 primary goals of this project. Firstly to preserve the original website for the 2012 version as best we could in code and design. However I did update some code and better optimize images. The living archive of the 2012 site was moved to its own repo to be accessible on the new Scout-App website under Scout-App.io/classic. The original URL had a new page created to offer visitors looking for Scout-App the original 2012 or new 2017 versions.",
